## Manually installing the agent

        1. Log in to a **pre-configured mac** with **Apple Configurator 2** installed, and open it

        2. **Plug in** one iPad at a time, it should show up in the app window

        3. **Click on the iPad** and select **Prepare** in the top banner. Click **Next** three times, and then **Prepare** again

        4. Wait until the pop-up in Apple Configurator 2 goes away

        5. Walk through setup on the iPad. It should prompt to enroll into an organization after network setup

        6. **Your done!**
