# Self-Enrolling in RMM

Let's dive into how to get **enrolled into RMM**

## Getting Started

Here, we will go through how to install and set up our **RMM Agent**.

:::warning
Apple has put policies in place that make it difficult to do some things without proper permissions on Macs. If we perform an action that prompts the need for permission, you might see the window in the image below. These permissions will need to be allowed when the prompt for it. These permission requests can happen with pre-enrolled devices as well.
:::

### What You'll Need

- You will have been provided a file that will help do the install. For MacOS, it will be a **.pkg** file, while Windows it will be a **.exe** file
- The **computer** or **computers** you'd like the agent installed on

## Manually Installing the Agent

        1. Log in to the computer using an **Administrator account**, or know the login to one on the computer.

        :::info
        For computers that only have one account, most times that account is an admin/elevated account. We need this for permission to install the agent.
        :::

        2. **Copy the file** to anywhere on the Mac

        3. **Double click the file** to start installing it, and click next in the bottom right of that window. When it prompts for a username and password, **ensure you use the administrator login details**.
        :::tip
        For Macs, you may have to open a .dmg file, to find the .pkg file, which is what you will actually install.
        :::

        4. Should say **successfuly installed**, and **you're done**! You can now **safely remove the file**.
